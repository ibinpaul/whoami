"""Fuse a semantic costmap and a geometry costmap into a final costmap.

Design law (architecture.md §9 / PROJECT_CONTEXT.md §3 & §7, Dev 3):
GEOMETRY LETHAL ALWAYS WINS. Semantic "traversable" must never clear a
geometric lethal obstacle, and semantic "unknown" must never be silently
turned into free space.

This module is ROS-independent: it only combines two same-shaped numpy
cost arrays that are assumed to already be in "cost space" (e.g. the
outputs of `semantic_costmap.build_semantic_costmap` and
`geometry_costmap.build_geometry_costmap`). It does not know about
classes, occupancy masks, camera projection, TF, or ROS messages.

            `geometry_costmap.build_geometry_costmap`).
        lethal_cost: the geometry cost value treated as lethal. Defaults
            to 254, matching `class_to_cost.CostValues.hazard_cost` and
            `geometry_costmap.GeometryCostValues.lethal_cost`.

        is mutated or returned by reference.

    Raises:
        CostmapFusionError: if `lethal_cost` is not an integer cost in
            0..255, if either input is not 2D, the two inputs
