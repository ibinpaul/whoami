"""ROS-independent robot footprint validation and padding.

A footprint is a 2D polygon given as an ordered sequence of (x, y)
vertices in metres, in the robot's own frame (the ring is implicitly
closed: the last vertex connects back to the first, and the first vertex
must NOT be repeated at the end).

This is the Dev 3 core implementation only: no Nav2 footprint messages,
no TF, no robot description parsing, and no robot-specific dimensions.
The real UGV footprint is owned by Dev 5 and is not known yet, so this
module has no default footprint -- callers must supply one explicitly
(e.g. loaded from configuration once Dev 5 provides it).

Padding semantics (defined here, NOT copied from Nav2): every edge of the
polygon is moved outward, perpendicular to itself, by exactly `padding`
metres, and adjacent offset edges are joined at their intersection
(a mitered offset). For a rectangle this grows each half-width/half-length
by `padding`. This differs from Nav2's `padFootprint`, which shifts each
vertex by `padding` along the sign of its x and y coordinates; the two
agree for origin-centred axis-aligned rectangles but not in general.

Only convex footprints are supported. A mitered offset of a convex
polygon is always a valid convex polygon; for concave polygons it can
self-intersect, so concave input is rejected loudly rather than producing
an ill-defined padded footprint.
